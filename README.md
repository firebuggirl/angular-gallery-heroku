    * Move
    `"@angular/compiler-cli": "^4.0.0"` from devDependencies to dependencies so that Heroku will read it.

    * add this to package.json:
    ` "engines": {
        "node": "6.9.5"

      }`

      ` touch server.js `

      ` npm i express --save `

      ` ng build  `

      ` npm start ` //starts index.html from dist folder

* take this out of .gitignore

    `/dist`
